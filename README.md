## How to Run Locally

Since this project consists of static HTML and CSS files, you can open it directly in your browser. However, for the best experience (especially for proper file path loading), it is recommended to run a local server.

### Option 1: Using VS Code Live Server (Recommended)
1.  Open the project folder `my web page` in **VS Code**.
2.  Install the **Live Server** extension.
3.  Right-click on `html/homepage.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.

### Option 2: Using Python
If you have Python installed, you can start a simple server:
1.  Open a terminal/command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the `my web page` folder:
    ```bash
    cd "c:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\kodnest html\my web page"
    ```
3.  Run the server:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
4.  Open your browser and search `http://localhost:8000/html/homepage.html`.

### Option 3: Double Click
You can simply navigate to `html/homepage.html` in your file explorer and double-click it. *Note: Some images/videos might not load correctly if browser security settings block local file access.*

## Deployment
To host this website online, you can use services like:
- **GitHub Pages**
- **Netlify**
- **Vercel**

Simply drag and drop the `my web page` folder into Netlify/Vercel dashboard to deploy.
